# Use-R

In this script, I will attempt to use Real-world ESRL-NOAA weather dataset and use it to make weather maps using R.

The data for this script is located in this repository under name of “air.mon.ltm.v401.nc” and “precip.mon.ltm.v401.nc”. However you are free to choose the latest data from the ESRL-NOAA website https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.UDel_AirT_Precip.html
